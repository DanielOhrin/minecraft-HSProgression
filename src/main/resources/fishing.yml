# Do not change the amount of items in the lists or attempt to change what is tracked for each item in the lists
# Ex: Each material can be changed, but it will not change what is actually being tracked

# Placeholders:
# {current} - The current item's display name with its color codes
# {current-no-color} - The current item's display name as plaintext (no color codes)
# {previous} - The previous item's display name with its color codes
# {previous-no-color} - the previous item's display name as plaintext (no color codes)
# {price} - Price to unlock the current upgrade
# {amount} - Amount of current item the island has tracked
# {required} - Required amount of items to unlock the upgrade purchase

# Important: Placeholders cannot be used everywhere. In-line comments will show where placeholders are available

lore:
  unlocked: # {amount} {current} {current-no-color}
    - "&7{amount} {current-no-color} Caught"
  locked: # {amount} {required} {previous} {previous-no-color} {price}
    - "&7{amount}/{required} {previous-no-color} Caught"
    - ""
    - "&7Cost: &a${price}"
